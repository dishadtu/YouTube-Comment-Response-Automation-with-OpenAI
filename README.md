# YouTube-Comment-Response-Automation-with-OpenAI
This project automates YouTube comment moderation using OpenAI’s GPT-3. It fetches comments, analyzes them to determine if a reply is needed (e.g., questions or requests for advice), and updates a database.

## Features
- **YouTube Comment Retrieval**: Fetches top comments from YouTube using the YouTube Data API.
- **LLM Decision and Response**: Uses OpenAI’s GPT-3 to decide if a comment needs a reply.
- **Database Integration**: Stores and updates comments in a MySQL (SingleStore) database.
- **Automated Workflow**: Automatically checks comments and updates the database with response recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: The core runtime environment for running the code.
- **OpenAI GPT-3**: For determining whether a comment needs a response.
- **YouTube Data API**: To retrieve comments from a specific YouTube video.
- **MySQL (SingleStore)**: For storing and managing comment data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
3. Set up your environment variables (for sensitive information like API keys and database credentials):

  You’ll need to set up your OpenAI API key, YouTube API key, and MySQL database credentials in your environment.
  Optionally, create a .env file to store these values:
  ```bash
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
  YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your-youtube-api-key
  DB_HOST=your-db-host
  DB_USER=your-db-user
  DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
  DB_NAME=your-db-name

4.  Run the application:

  ```bash
  
  node index.js
```
## How It Works

1. **Retrieve Comments**: The system fetches comments from a specified YouTube video using the YouTube Data API.
2. **AI Response Decision**: The comments are analyzed by GPT-3, which determines if a reply is needed (e.g., a question or a request for advice).
3. **Update Database**: Comments needing a response are flagged in the database, ensuring content creators know which comments to reply to.
